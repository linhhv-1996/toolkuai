2026 is the year of the "Local Web." As users become more aware of data mining, the demand for private tools is skyrocketing. 

ToolKuai is committed to building over 20+ new tools this year, including advanced PDF editors, audio converters, and privacy-focused text analysis—all running 100% on the client side. 

Our goal is simple: to be the fastest, safest directory for everyday tasks. No accounts, no cookies, no tracking. Just pure utility.
