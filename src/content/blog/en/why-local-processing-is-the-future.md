In a world where every click is tracked, ToolKuai takes a different path. Most online tools require you to upload your files to their servers. But what happens to your data once it's there? 

With **local processing**, your files never leave your computer. We use your browser's own power to compress images, convert formats, and process data. 

**Why this matters:**
1. **Absolute Privacy:** No server-side storage means zero risk of data leaks.
2. **Lightning Speed:** No upload or download wait times.
3. **Offline Ready:** Once the page is loaded, the tools work even without internet.

At ToolKuai, we believe privacy isn't a feature—it's a right.
