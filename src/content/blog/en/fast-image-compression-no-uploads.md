Stop uploading your private photos to random servers just to resize them. ToolKuai's Image Compressor runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly.

Whether you're a developer optimizing assets or just clearing space on your phone, our local engine ensures that your images stay yours. No more "Processing..." spinners that take forever—just instant, high-quality results.

**Pro Tip:** You can even use our tools in "Incognito Mode" for an extra layer of peace of mind!
