## Why You Need to Compress Your Videos

In the age of high-definition content, 4K and Full HD videos are standard. However, these high-quality files come with "gigantic" sizes that create several bottlenecks:
- **Email & Messaging Limits:** Most platforms (Gmail, Outlook, Discord) limit attachments to 25MB - 100MB.
- **Storage Costs:** Large files quickly drain your iPhone storage, Android memory, and cloud space (iCloud/Google Drive).
- **Slow Website Performance:** Heavy videos kill your page load speed, hurting your SEO rankings and user experience.

## ToolKuai - A Revolutionary Way to Compress

Most online video compressors force you to upload your files to their servers. This is slow, eats your bandwidth, and risks your data privacy.

**ToolKuai changes the game with Local Processing technology:**
1. **100% Privacy:** Your videos never leave your device. The compression happens right inside your browser.
2. **Lightning Fast:** No waiting for uploads or downloads. The speed depends solely on your hardware.
3. **Multi-Format Support:** MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV—we handle them all.

## Factors That Affect Video File Size

To compress effectively while keeping the "crisp" look, you need to understand these three pillars:

### 1. Resolution
Reducing resolution (e.g., from 4K to 1080p or 720p) is the fastest way to shrink a file. For mobile viewing, 720p is often indistinguishable from higher resolutions.

### 2. Bitrate
Bitrate is the amount of data processed per second. High bitrate equals high quality but larger size. ToolKuai uses smart algorithms to optimize bitrate, retaining maximum detail where it matters most.

### 3. Frame Rate (FPS)
For tutorials or presentations, lowering FPS from 60 to 30 can save nearly half the file size without a noticeable drop in smoothness.
